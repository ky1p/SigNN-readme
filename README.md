## Abstract
Our project does real-time translation of American Sign Language into English text (characters only for now); all data was self-collected and we used google collab to collect, agregate, and analyze data. We acheived this objective using Openpose, a multi-person system to jointly detect human body, hand, facial, and foot keypoints (in total 135 keypoints) on single images.

## Motivation
There have been many attempts at creating a similar project like ours but none work very well. So, we wanted to make one such project that works best. We knew this was going to be a difficult undertaking which is why we wanted to work on this project. We don't do it because it's easy; we do it because it's hard.
