##Abstract
Our project does real-time translation of American Sign Language into English text (characters only for now); all data was self-collected and we used google collab to collect, agregate, and analyze data. We acheived this objective using Openpose, a multi-person system to jointly detect human body, hand, facial, and foot keypoints (in total 135 keypoints) on single images.
